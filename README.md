# 1000G_Summary_Stats
This repository contains scripts related to the empirical analyses of 1000 Genome dataset associated with Beichman et al. (in progress)

These individuals are extracted from 1000 Genomes:

#YRI:
NA18505, NA18517, NA18916, NA18923, NA18877, NA18909, NA18858, NA18865, NA19116, NA19096
#CEU:
NA06984, NA06985, NA06986, NA06989, NA06994, NA07000, NA07037, NA07051, NA07056, NA07347
#CHB:
NA18525, NA18526, NA18528, NA18530, NA18531, NA18532, NA18533, NA18534, NA18535, NA18536

To subset the 1000G vcf for each of these populations:

> ./subset_YRI.sh

> ./subset_CEU.sh

> ./subset_CHB.sh

*Note that currenly the script is set up to run on UCLA Hoffman HPC*
